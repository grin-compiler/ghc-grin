Here is some testing code which may also serve as a sample client.

Base system
~~~~~~~~~~~
  Ast.hs         Abstract syntax for a language of basic blocks,
                 instructions, and calls

  IR.hs          Intermediate Representation of a procedure whose body is a
                 Hoopl control-flow graph.

  Expr.hs        Definition of expressions used in both Ast and IR

  Ast2ir.hs      Translation from Ast to IR.  The highlight is mapping
                 the string labels in the source from the abstract Labels
                 defined by Hoopl.

  Ir2Ast.hs      Translated from IR to Ast. The original string Labels to the
                 abstract Labels mappings are used to do this translation.


Optimizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  ConstProp.hs   Constant propagation as described in the paper.

  Live.hs        Live-variable analysis and dead-assignment elimination.

  Simplify.s     A simplifier for expressions, written as a "deep
                 forward rewriter" for Hoopl.  Used in constant
                 propagation. 

  OptSupport.hs  Mysterious functions to support lattice computations
                 and expression-crawling.  May one day be documented.
                 Eventually may be migrated into Hoopl in generic
                 form, to support multiple clients.


Interpreter
~~~~~~~~~~~
  Eval.hs        An interpreter for control-flow graphs.  We'd like to
                 make this code higher-order.

  EvalMonad.hs   A monad that maintains the state used by the
                 interpreter: a value for every variable, plus values
                 on the heap.


Testing
~~~~~~~
  Main.hs        Just hacking---there's no real testing code yet

  

Other
~~~~~
  Parse.hs       A parser built using Parsec---does not depend on
                 Hoopl at all.

  PP.hs          A work in progress?
